# Digital Signal Processing tools for Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nils-werner/dspy.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nils-werner/dspy)

This small library has initially been created as a integrated part of a diploma thesis.
While the thesis took form, this library has been desiged to become more and more abstract
from the code relevant to the research I was conducting.

The code in this library is not revolutionary new DSP techniques that cannot be found in SciPy.
Instead, it consists mostly of "handy day to day stuff" like easy filtering, spectrogram-
generation and an overlap-add-mechanism.

In its first version as an independend library, it has now gained the standard library
layout (`setup.py` and the like) and was released as open source on GitHub.
